#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

A function is coding that is meant to perform an action or calculation. It is used when you want to evaluate and manipulate data.

#### 2. What is a method?

Methods relate to objects but perform operations much like functions do.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?

indexOf()
charAt()
toUppercase()
replace()

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?

An accessor method just uses the original value declared in an array whereas a mutator method actually changes the original value to a new value. The accessor method is used when you want to be able to re-use the original array values somewhere else in your program.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?

A return stops a function after it has completed all the steps which are written right before the return. A console.log is used to actually view information on the console. You would use returns in order to execute a function and you then can use that value somewhere else within your program. You insert console.logs into your program in order to display the information on the console so you can ensure your program is executing correctly or when debugging.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?

The pair programming was definitely the greatest help this week. I was fortunate to be partnered up with several strong people throughout the week which helped in figuring out some of the concepts that were just not clicking.
