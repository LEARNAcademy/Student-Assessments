#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is code that basically does something. It also has to be called upon to operate. You would use a function when you need some accomplished, possibly more than once as it reusable.
#### 2. What is a method?
A method is an action that can be called on an array of items or object. There are built in methods in JS and you can create your own essentially.
#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
String methods are methods that can only be called on strings. Some examples are: `.length` and `.indexOf()`
#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
Accessor methods "get" information where mutator methods change information. You would use accessors to view or pull out information to evaluate or check/compare. You would use mutator methods to modify/alter/change information as needed.
#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
Console.log() logs the information to the terminal. It's a tool developers can use to test their code for proper outputs. Return explicitly returns what is requested but it also ends the function or loop that it is called within, preventing any code located below it, to run.
#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?  
Paired programming really beats the concepts into the head. It helps me so much because, there are things that I have grasped onto more than my partner and there are things that he/she has grasped onto more than I. By coding together, we help each others questions and "grey areas" clear up in my opinion. It's a great way to learn.
